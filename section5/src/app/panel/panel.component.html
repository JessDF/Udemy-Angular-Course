<!--
  If you are creating a re-usable component and you want the consumer to be able to add custom content then:
    Use the ng-content component
  Note: you don't need a selector if you have only 1 ng-content
-->

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <!-- 
      If in the consumer of panel component we have an element that matches this selector (heading class) that element will be placed here
        ng-content will be re-placed with that element
    -->
    <ng-content select=".heading"></ng-content>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <ng-content select=".body"></ng-content>
  </div>
</div>
